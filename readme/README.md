This is a fork of JeeLab's fantastic real time clock library for STM32.

Works great with Adafruit RTC breakouts:

- [DS3231 Precision RTC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3013)
- [PCF8523 RTC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3295)
- [DS1307 RTC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3296)

Please note that dayOfTheWeek() ranges from 0 to 6 inclusive with 0 being 'Sunday'.

Compatability: STM32
